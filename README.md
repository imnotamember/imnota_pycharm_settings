# imnota_pycharm_settings
My ongoing adaptations of PyCharm's settings

This is primarily for my sanity, to maintain consistency across my computers/projects.
Hopefully it can also be of use as a quick-start optimization for anyone new to PyCharm and/or Python.

Feel free to let me know if you have issues getting this operational on your system.
